// incase, we be using any video/audio component -> we have to make sure that we are using provider ->so that the application is always authenticated

//  IMPORTANT:- 
// How do we upload any data? --> whenever any data is uploaded, we use the imagekit component and the image/video goes inside the imagekit component
// --> because the endpoint automatically hits it
// --> it uploads that image/video and 
// --> returns back the body 

// in this file -> we only gonna work on route
// our job in the upload is that take the data (userID and image) from the frontend -> take it onto the upload endpoint and save it in the database.
